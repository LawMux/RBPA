Very basic Rules Based Parity Analysis calculator following https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1233&amp;context=ckjip

You can find a demo here:  http://lawmux.com/parity_demo/

While the paper attempts to be rigorous and thorough, informally, you can get the gist of the process by reviewing FIG. 10.  This initial calculator is VERY simplistic and will be supplemented with additional example rules over time.  Similarly, this version anticipates configuration in-code rather than via a friendly user interface, so appending the latter may be helpful depending on your use case.
